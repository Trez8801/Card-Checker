This program uses multiple arrow functions.The first function goes through each array of credit card numbers to determine wether or not it is valid.

The second function will then put all invalid credit card numbers into a separate array called "invalid". This way the final function is then able to determine what company each invalid credit card number belgons to and then add that company to another array.
